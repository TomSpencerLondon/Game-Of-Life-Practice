//Implement a finite version of Conway's Game of Life.
//
//        Here are the rules (courtesy of Wikipedia):
//
//        The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal
//        grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states:
//        alive or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours,
//        which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent to it.
//        At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
//
//        Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
//        Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
//        Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
//        Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
//        The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by
//        applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seedâ€”births and deaths occur
//        simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick
//        (in other words, each generation is a pure function of the preceding one)
//
//        Your game should be constructed with initial state of a two-dimensional array
//        of boolean values, and a single public method to move to the next generation:
//
//public class GameOfLife {
//    public GameOfLife(boolean[][] board);
//    public void nextGen();
//}

//Write a cellular automata that models the Game of Life
//        Requirement Cards:
//        A cell can be made "alive"
//        A cell can be "killed"
//        A cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies of under-population
//        A cell with 2 or 3 live neighbours lives on to the next generation
//        A cell with more than 3 live neighbours dies of overcrowding
//        An empty cell with exactly 3 live neighbours "comes to life"
//        The board should wrap
